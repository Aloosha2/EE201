Hi! This is my about me page :grin:


## About me
I am a second-year student at the University of Washington studying Electrical and Computer Engineering. I originally from Poland but my family moved to Redmond, Washington. I have one cat back at home and his name is snowball :cat: I am excited for EE 201!

### Hobbies
Outside of class I like to read books, play some video games, and get boba! I was a competitive swimmer for 10 years so I also enjoy swimming. In addition, I like to watch when I have time,, some of my favorite shows are Kakegurui and Lycoris Recoil :hushed:
